DAC Approach for Closest Pair in 2D

Brute Force Complexity
Checking all pairs of points in 2D takes O(n^2).


Divide-and-Conquer Approach

Divide:
Split the points into left and right halves based on the x-coordinates.

Conquer:
Recursively find the closest pair in each half.

Combine:
Consider cross-boundary pairs that lie within the minimum distance found in the two halves.
This step ensures that points near the partition line are checked efficiently.


Improved Complexity

Sorting the points: O(nlogn)
Recursive calls: O(n)
Total complexity: O(nlogn) -> Faster than brute-force 


Scalability

Sorting once at the start improves efficiency.
Recursive pruning reduces unnecessary comparisons.


Conclusion

On a circle, sorting + modular arithmetic gives an O(nlogn) approach.
In 2D, a Divide-and-Conquer method reduces complexity from O(n^2) to O(nlogn), making it scalable for large datasets.
