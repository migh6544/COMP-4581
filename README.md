# COMP-4581
Advanced Algorithms for Data Science

### Course Overview 
This course provides an introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms for the data 
science student. Topics covered include asymptotic complexity and algorithm design techniques 
such as incremental, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and 
backtracking. Additionally, fundamental data structures such as stack, queues, heaps, trees, 
and hashing are covered, as well as their role in the design of efficient algorithms. Although the 
Python programming language is extensively used in examples and assignments, this class is 
not about Python. Rather, we will emphasize computational solutions to problems and the role 
of efficient algorithms as a tool for exploring and processing large data sets. 
 
### Objectives 
Students will be able to estimate the efficiency of algorithms and predict running times. 
Students will be able to select the appropriate data structure and algorithm paradigm for a given 
problem. They will be able to turn the design of their solution into efficient code using the 
paradigms and data structures covered in class. Finally, by the end of this course, students will 
better appreciate the importance of careful algorithm design when processing large data sets.
